##  _Building a chatbot to analyze PDF documents using the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) definition involves several steps. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for tasks like text analysis. In this case, we'll use Python and some popular libraries for natural language processing and deep learning. We'll use the PyTorch library to implement the LSTM model._

## Definition

This passage provides an overview of the process involved in creating a chatbot that can analyze PDF documents, with a focus on utilizing Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

- Objective: The goal is to build a chatbot capable of analyzing PDF documents. The emphasis is on understanding the content within these documents, and LSTM networks will be used for this purpose.

- LSTM Networks: Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is introduced as a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). LSTMs are known for their ability to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. In the context of text analysis, this means LSTMs can understand and remember relationships between words or characters that are spaced far apart in a document.

- Choice of Programming Language and Libraries: Python is chosen as the programming language for implementing the chatbot. Python is widely used in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Additionally, the implementation will leverage popular libraries for natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.

- PyTorch Library: The PyTorch library is specified as the tool for implementing the LSTM model. PyTorch is a machine learning library that provides dynamic computational graphs, making it well-suited for tasks involving deep learning and neural networks.

In summary, the passage outlines the intention to build a chatbot using LSTM networks, provides a brief explanation of LSTM's suitability for text analysis, specifies the programming language (Python), and selects the PyTorch library for implementing the LSTM model. The subsequent code examples (not provided in this response) would detail the actual implementation steps, such as extracting text from PDFs, preprocessing the data, defining and training the LSTM model, and creating a simple chatbot interface.
